# Cheatsheets

I started this repository after I started making a cheatsheet as I was learning Go. Planning to expand this project to more languages (and maybe even other concepts related to programming) in the future.

## Contents

### 1. [Go cheatsheet](./golang.md)
(Work in Progress)
The cheatsheet is a quick summary of the basic features provided by the Go language. At times, it refers to similar features in C/Python, so having a knowledge of those languages helps, but is not required. Although some basic level experience in programming is recommended, because it does not cover everything in-depth. So unless Go is the first language you are learning, this cheatsheet should be pretty useful for you.

Most of the content has been taken from [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/), I just compiled, summarised and rearranged it.

## Contributions

Want to contribute? Awesome!

Contributions to existing cheatsheets as well as adding new cheatsheets is much appreciated. Please stick to the format of the existing cheatsheet while making changes/new contributions.

If you wish to work on a new cheatsheet, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/codelixir/cheatsheets/issues/new) before you start working on it.
